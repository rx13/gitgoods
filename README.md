# gitgoods
An immature utility script to identify domain-related potentially sensitive materials on GitHub via API v3

## Notes
The keywords and domains files were left with a couple examples. (Not related)
 - Deloitte because it has one of the most disparate code footprints on github (apparently)
 - Uber because they got f**ked via git, so it just made sense.

# Usage
    Eventually
